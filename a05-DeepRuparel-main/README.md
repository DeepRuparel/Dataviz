## Notes
You can simply run this by opening the index.html in your browser. The environment I used is macOS and the browser I used is chrome but I also checked it on safari and I believe it produced the same results.

## Extra Credit
when the user selects a file, a histogram is generated beneath the opacity point chooser, which represents data density. 
This histogram will allow a user to identify separate clusters of data and color-code them later on. The density graph being displayed can be toggled using `should_plot_density_graph` in `a05.js`.
