# Dataviz

This is a repository which consists my assignments for the course CSC 544 I took in Spring 2023. This repository contains code for visualizations using d3 library and using javascript. 
It contains viz like scatterplotrs, SPLOMS, paralled co-ordinates, Tree maps, rasterization and flow visualization.

Each file consists a seperate README which provides instructions on how to run the files.
