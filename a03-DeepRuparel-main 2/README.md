## Notes
You can simply run this by opening the index.html in your browser. The environment I used is macOS and the browser I used is chrome but I also checked it on safari and I believe it produced the same results.

## Extra Credit
As extra credit I have used the invert axes from the extra credit section which switches the minimum and maximum across all the axes. \
Inver-axes button: Inverts the axes of the plot
Revert axes : Reverts the changes back to normal.
