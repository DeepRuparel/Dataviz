## Notes
You can simply run this by opening the index.html in your browser. The environment I used is macOS and the browser I used is chrome but I also checked it on safari and I believe it produced the same results.


## Extra crdit

For the extra credit I have implemented two sliders/pickers that allow the user to control the value of `dt` and the `steps` as per their choice. To allow the best 
visualization I have set the default values of `dt` upon uploading a new dataset. But this value can be changes as per the need of the user. I would like to add that since the values are calculated in the background upon change, it might take a few seconds to render the new values.
