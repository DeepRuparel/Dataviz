## Notes
You can simply run this by opening the index.html in your browser. The environment I used is macOS and the browser I used is chrome but I also checked it on safari and I believe it produced the same results.

## Extra Credit
 I have implemented the extra credit part for the assignment. I have added a tooltip which upon hovering on a element shows what the name of the element is and the depth of it is, what is the size and what is the count if there are any children for the node. \
 I have also added a legend which shows for which depth what color is associated with it. 
## Included files
* a04.js : It includes the code to draw tree-maps.
* a04.css : It includes css for the tooltip.
* test-cases.js : The simple test cases for tree maps.
* flare.js : A more complicated test case to test tree-maps.
* README.md : File to undersatnd what the project is about.
* index.html : The webpage which renders the javascript from a04.js file and answers questions asked in the assignment. 
* d3.js : The d3.js file which contains all the functions of the d3 library.
