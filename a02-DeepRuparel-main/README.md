## Notes
You can simply run this by opening the index.html in your browser. The environment I used is macOS and the browser I used is chrome but I also checked it on safari and I believe it produced the same results.

## Extra Credit
As an additional visual element, that will allow the utility of SPLOM, I have added a legend depending upon the dataset. A simple legend containing three rectangles for the three species according to their color and a linear gradient for the gpa of students varying from red to blue.

## Included files

* a02.js : It includes the code to get a splom and has the code for brushing and linking among all the plotted cells.
* iris.js : The dataset for iris. 
* score.js : The dataset for the scores of stundets from Calvin College 2004. 
* README.md : File to undersatnd what the project is about.
* index.html : The webpage which renders the javascript from a02.js file and answers questions asked in the assignment. 
* d3.js : The d3.js file which contains all the functions of the d3 library.
