## To run this file

You can just open the index.html in your browser & it should work. The environment I used is macOS and the browser I used is chrome but I also checked it on safari and I believe it produced the same results. I made use of the helper functions to get the rgb values rounded between 0 and 255, to do this in svg, I used the clamp function provided in reference material for question 2 and for d3.js I used the clampi function provided in d3.js.
